# 💡 CodeGen Helper

**CodeGen Helper** is a front-end web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that simulates an AI assistant which generates or enhances code based on a user's custom prompt and uploaded JavaScript file.  

This project is designed for students, frontend developers, or beginners who want to simulate a code generation workflow without needing actual AI APIs or backend servers.

## ✨ Project Objective

The main goal of CodeGen Helper is to demonstrate the frontend structure of a web-based code assistant tool. It showcases:
- Prompt handling
- File reading using FileReader API
- Simulated AI response display
- Responsive UI structure using pure CSS

Even without OpenAI or any backend logic, the simulation works well for presentations, internships, and educational purposes.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Prompt input from user
- ✅ Upload a JavaScript file (.js)
- ✅ File content is read and displayed
- ✅ Simulated AI-generated output appears below
- ✅ Fully client-side; works offline
- ✅ Clean, minimalist UI with good UX

---

## 🧠 How It Works

When the user:
1. **Enters a prompt** like “Convert to ES6”
2. **Uploads a `.js` file** from their system
3. **Clicks “Generate Code”**

Then the script:
- Reads the uploaded file
- Combines prompt + content
- Simulates AI-generated output (placeholder)
- Displays it in a styled code block
